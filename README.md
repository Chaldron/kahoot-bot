# Kahoot Bot (DEPRECATED)

This is a simple, GUI-based Kahoot bot written in Node.js using Electron. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To run the application, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Then, simply download and run the project, after installing the necessary dependencies: 

`git clone https://github.com/Chaldron/kahoot-bot`

`cd kahoot-bot`

`npm i`

`npm start`

Alternatively, binary builds are available on the releases page. Currently, these only support Windows 64-bit.
